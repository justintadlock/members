 * Conditional tag to check if a user can view a specific post.  A user cannot view a post if their user role has 
 * not been selected in the 'Content Permissions' meta box on the edit post screen in the admin.  Non-logged in 
 * site visitors cannot view posts if roles were selected.  If no roles were selected, all users and site visitors 
 * can view the content.
 *
 * There are exceptions to this rule though.  The post author, any user with the 'restrict_content' capability, 
 * and users that have the ability to edit the post can always view the post, even if their role was not granted 
 * permission to view it.
 *
 * @todo See how feasible it is to just use the normal user_can() WordPress function to check against a meta 
 * capability such as 'members_view_post' while hooking into 'map_meta_cap' or 'user_has_cap' to roll custom 
 * plugin handling for this. This would just be a wrapper tag.
 *
 * @since 0.2.0
 * @param int $user_id The ID of the user to check.
 * @param int $post_id The ID of the post to check.
 * @return bool True if the user can view the post. False if the user cannot view the post.
